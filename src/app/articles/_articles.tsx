## Part 1: Concepts - What Is ABAC and Why It Matters

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** is a powerful and flexible way to control who can do what in your application. Instead of just checking roles (like "admin" or "editor"), ABAC checks **attributes** of the user, the resource, and the context.

### üîê What is ABAC?

- A user can edit a post **only if they are the owner**
- A viewer can only read a document **if it is published**
- An admin can manage all posts, **regardless of ownership**

### üÜö ABAC vs. RBAC

| Model | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RBAC | Role-Based Access Control | Editors can edit all posts |
| ABAC | Attribute-Based Access Control | Editors edit **only their own** posts |

ABAC is more granular and expressive. It fits real-world rules better, especially in multi-tenant systems or apps with complex permissions.

### üéØ Benefits of ABAC in Modern Web Apps

- ‚úÖ Centralized and reusable logic
- ‚úÖ Better security boundaries
- ‚úÖ Declarative and testable
- ‚úÖ Easy to adapt over time

### üì¶ Why BHVR + ABAC

The **BHVR stack** (Bun + Hono + Vite + React) is fast and modern - and with ABAC, you can enforce authorization in both backend and frontend using shared logic:

- **Backend (Hono)**: Validate permissions before returning sensitive data
- **Frontend (React)**: Show/hide buttons, links, or features based on access
- **Shared TypeScript**: Avoid duplication and keep logic consistent

## Part 2: Tutorial - ABAC in Practice with the BHVR Stack

### üß∞ Prerequisites

- Bun installed https://bun.sh/docs/installation
- SQLite available (optional: Drizzle can embed it)
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and React

### üèóÔ∏è Step 1 - Setup Project Structure

\`\`\`bash
mkdir bhvr-abac
cd bhvr-abac
bun init -y
mkdir -p apps/api apps/web packages/shared
\`\`\`

We're following a **monorepo** layout using Bun as the toolchain.

### üîß Step 2 - Backend with Bun, Hono and Drizzle

\`\`\`bash
cd apps/api
bun add hono drizzle-orm drizzle-kit zod
bun add -D drizzle-kit
\`\`\`

Create a \`tsconfig.json\` in \`apps/api\`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "strict": true,
    "types": ["bun-types"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

Create your schema:

\`\`\`tsx
// apps/api/schema.ts
import { sqliteTable, text, integer } from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core";

export const usersTable = sqliteTable("users", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  email: text("email").notNull(),
  role: text("role").notNull(), // admin, editor, viewer
  department: text("department")
});

export const postsTable = sqliteTable("posts", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  title: text("title").notNull(),
  content: text("content").notNull(),
  ownerId: text("owner_id").notNull(),
  isPublished: integer("is_published", { mode: "boolean" }).default(false)
});
\`\`\`

Generate migrations:

\`\`\`bash
bunx drizzle-kit generate:sqlite --schema=./schema.ts
\`\`\`

### üîê Step 3 - Create the ABAC Logic (Shared)

\`\`\`tsx
// packages/shared/auth/abac.ts
export type User = {
  id: string;
  role: "admin" | "editor" | "viewer";
  department?: string;
};

export type Resource = {
  ownerId: string;
  isPublished: boolean;
};

export type Action = "read" | "edit" | "delete" | "publish";

export function can(user: User, action: Action, resource: Resource): boolean {
  if (user.role === "admin") return true;

  if (user.role === "editor") {
    if (action === "read") return resource.isPublished || resource.ownerId === user.id;
    if (action === "edit" || action === "delete") return resource.ownerId === user.id;
    if (action === "publish") return resource.ownerId === user.id;
  }

  if (user.role === "viewer") {
    return action === "read" && resource.isPublished;
  }

  return false;
}
\`\`\`

You can import this logic in both backend and frontend.

### üõ°Ô∏è Step 4 - Protect Hono API Routes

\`\`\`tsx
// apps/api/routes/posts.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { can } from '../../../packages/shared/auth/abac';
import { db } from '../db';

const postsRoute = new Hono();

postsRoute.get('/:id', async (c) => {
  const user = c.get('user'); // assume user is set by auth middleware
  const id = c.req.param('id');
  const post = await db.query.posts.findFirst({ where: (p) => p.id.eq(id) });

  if (!post || !can(user, 'read', post)) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, 403);
  }

  return c.json(post);
});
\`\`\`

### üñºÔ∏è Step 5 - React Frontend with Conditional UI

\`\`\`bash
cd apps/web
bun create vite . --template react-ts
bun install
\`\`\`

Then:

\`\`\`tsx
// apps/web/src/components/PostActions.tsx
import { can, User, Resource } from '@shared/auth/abac';

export function PostActions({ user, post }: { user: User; post: Resource }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {can(user, 'edit', post) && <button>Edit</button>}
      {can(user, 'delete', post) && <button>Delete</button>}
      {can(user, 'publish', post) && <button>Publish</button>}
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

This ensures the UI only shows actions that the user is allowed to perform.

### üß™ Step 6 - Write Simple Tests

\`\`\`tsx
// packages/shared/auth/abac.test.ts
import { can } from './abac';

const user = { id: 'u1', role: 'editor' };
const post = { ownerId: 'u1', isPublished: false };

console.assert(can(user, 'edit', post), 'Editor should edit their own post');
console.assert(!can(user, 'delete', { ...post, ownerId: 'u2' }), 'Editor should not delete others' posts');
\`\`\`

Run it:

\`\`\`bash
bun run abac.test.ts
\`\`\`

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

By separating the **concepts** (ABAC) from the **implementation** (BHVR + Drizzle + React), you now have:

- A maintainable and scalable access control system
- Logic enforced across both API and UI layers
- A project scaffold ready to grow with your needs

## üß≠ What's Next?

- Store dynamic ABAC rules in your database
- Build a full admin interface for user/role management
- Integrate session-based auth and tenant isolation
- Add real-world testing using Vitest or Playwright

## Introduction

Security is not a feature‚Äîit‚Äôs a foundational pillar of any modern web application. As systems grow in complexity, so do access control requirements. Traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can quickly become insufficient for applications requiring context-aware decisions. This is where **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** becomes essential.

ABAC allows fine-grained control by evaluating a combination of attributes related to the user, resource, and environment. In this article, we‚Äôll walk through the core logic of implementing ABAC in a scalable and maintainable way using users, roles, and permissions managed in a relational database.

---

## Core Concepts of ABAC

ABAC decisions are made based on **attributes**, typically categorized as:

- **Subject attributes**: Characteristics of the user (e.g., role, department, clearance level).
- **Resource attributes**: Properties of the data or object (e.g., resource owner, sensitivity).
- **Action attributes**: The type of operation (e.g., read, write, delete).
- **Environment attributes**: External context (e.g., time of day, IP address, device).

The decision to authorize an action is based on evaluating policies defined as combinations of these attributes.

---

## Architectural Overview

ABAC builds on a few foundational data structures that map users to roles and permissions‚Äîbut extends far beyond this mapping by introducing dynamic conditions.

### 1. User Management

Each user is represented in the system with associated attributes:

- Basic identity fields (email, name)
- Static attributes (role, department, region)
- Dynamic attributes (e.g., time of login, current project)

### 2. Roles and Permissions

Roles help group sets of permissions for easier administration. Each permission defines a **scope** of actions allowed on a resource.

A typical design involves:

- A **roles table** with unique names and descriptions.
- A **permissions table** defining actions and target resources.
- A **role_permission** join table mapping roles to permissions.

### 3. Policies and Conditions

Policies define rules for evaluating access based on attributes. This is where ABAC deviates from RBAC.

Policies may include conditions like:

- A user can only edit a project if they are the project owner.
- A regional manager can view reports only from their region.
- Engineers can deploy only during work hours and only to their assigned environments.

These rules are not hard-coded but stored and evaluated dynamically, often using an internal policy engine or a rules engine.

---

## Access Evaluation Flow

Here‚Äôs how access evaluation typically works in an ABAC-enabled system:

1. **User Authenticates**  
   Identity is verified and user attributes are loaded (e.g., roles, departments, claims).

2. **Request is Made**  
   The user attempts to perform an action on a resource (e.g., \`DELETE /project/42\`).

3. **Policy Context is Built**  
   The system gathers:  
   - Subject attributes: user‚Äôs role, department  
   - Resource attributes: project‚Äôs owner, region  
   - Action attributes: \`delete\`  
   - Environment attributes: current time, IP

4. **Policy Evaluation**  
   A policy engine evaluates whether this set of attributes satisfies at least one access policy.

5. **Decision is Returned**  
   The request is either allowed or denied.


---

## Storing Policies and Conditions

There are multiple approaches for storing ABAC policies in a database:

#### Declarative Rules (Recommended)

Policies are expressed as logical expressions and stored as JSON or DSL (Domain-Specific Language) in a policies table. These rules are parsed and evaluated at runtime.

For example:

| Policy Name     | Resource | Action | Condition                                          |
|------------------|----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Own project edit | project  | edit   | \`user.id == resource.owner_id\`                    |
| HR view salary   | salary   | view   | \`user.department == "HR"\`                         |
| Regional read    | report   | read   | \`user.region == resource.region && env.time < 20\` |

This makes policies editable without code changes and supports admin-driven customization.

---

## Performance and Reliability Considerations

ABAC evaluations can become expensive if not designed carefully. Here are key considerations:

- **Attribute Caching**: Cache subject and resource attributes that don‚Äôt change frequently to avoid repeated lookups.
- **Index Resource Attributes**: If resource attributes are stored in DB, ensure they are indexed to support fast lookups.
- **Policy Compilation**: Pre-compile or cache parsed policies to reduce evaluation latency.
- **Fail-Closed**: Always default to "deny" if policy evaluation fails or is inconclusive.
- **Audit Logs**: Store decision logs for compliance and debugging.

## ABAC vs RBAC: When to Choose What

| Feature           | RBAC                   | ABAC                                     |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Simplicity       | ‚úÖ Simple               | ‚ùå More complex to design                |
| Flexibility      | ‚ùå Limited              | ‚úÖ High‚Äîsupports contextual decisions    |
| Scalability      | ‚ùå Role explosion       | ‚úÖ Scales with attributes, not roles     |
| Admin Friendly   | ‚úÖ Easy to manage roles | ‚ùå Requires a UI for policy management   |

**Best practice**: Use RBAC for base permissions and layer ABAC on top for contextual restrictions.

---

## Final Thoughts

ABAC unlocks highly flexible and secure access control by evaluating the full context of each request. However, it demands careful design of attributes, policies, and evaluation logic.

In a production-grade implementation:
- Model users, roles, permissions clearly.
- Separate static RBAC from dynamic ABAC layers.
- Use a consistent format for policy storage and evaluation.
- Monitor performance and audit access decisions.

ABAC is not just a security upgrade‚Äîit‚Äôs an architectural enabler for fine-grained, dynamic authorization in modern web apps.
